# Get in touch

The best way to reach me is by email at [phils@hey.com](mailto:phils@hey.com). I'm usually happy to talk about stuff, even if I don't know you - especially if you follow [this cold email advice](https://sriramk.com/coldemail).

I check email once a day in the evening, and try to respond within two days. If I'm swamped and don't manage to, feel free to ping me after that!
