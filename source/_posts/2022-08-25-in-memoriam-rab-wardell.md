# In Memoriam: Rab Wardell

Today I am saddened by the news of the passing of Scottish mountain biker [Rab Wardell](https://www.rabwardell.com), who [died in his sleep](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/24/mountain-bike-rider-rab-wardell-dies-aged-37) two days after winning the Scottish MTB XC Championships.

Rab had been racing mountain bikes since he was a teenager, but only went professional last year. His drive and commitment to cycling was second to none. Whether it was bike-packing to - and then competing in - a [gravel race in Belgium](https://www.rabwardell.com/post/2018/11/05/bikepack-to-belgium-photo-essay), or setting a [record-breaking time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZVAbtKgPYk) to ride the West Highland Way, his antics always inspired me to up my game and just get out and ride my bike.

I actually met him a few of times back when I lived in Scotland (ten years ago!). We frequented the same local bike shop in Edinburgh and he was always happy to have a yarn while we were standing at the checkout.

My thoughts go out to his family and friends, and to the wider cycling community that was touched by his spirit.

His untimely death at 37 - reportedly from cardiac arrest - is a stark reminder that there really is no better time than now to get out there and achieve your goals.

Keep on sending-it in the bike park in the sky, mate.
