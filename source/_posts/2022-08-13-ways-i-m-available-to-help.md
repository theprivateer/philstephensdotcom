# Ways I'm Available to Help

Over the past 15+ years I've worked with some great (and some not-so-great) people to whom I owe a lot. I've worked at award-winning marketing agencies, tech start-ups, mature scale-ups and total f**k-ups. I've learnt a lot about what works (and even more about what doesn't), and now it's my turn to give something back.

## Ways I’m available to help anyone

- Answer concise questions [via email](mailto:phils@hey.com) about topics I know about
- Introductions
- Give you feedback on a resume and/or cover letter

## Ways I’m available to help underrepresented people in tech

- Everything above, _I’ll especially do for you_
- [Connect on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/phil-stephens/)
- Help you find some job opportunities
- [Validate your business idea](/validating-your-business-idea) and/or join your advisory board
- Review a conference proposal

## Want something else?

[Drop me an email](mailto:phils@hey.com) - I'll consider any reasonable request and if there is anything I can do to add value, I will.
