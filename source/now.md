# What I'm Doing Now

_This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). It was last updated December 4, 2022._

## Work

A recent change at [Rex](https://rexsoftware.com.au) means that I now find myself heading up _two_ engineering teams as Technical Lead. There's going to be heaps of work bringing myself up to speed with the new team and what we're working on, but I am grateful for the opportunity.

## Side-Projects

I decided to [close down Subworthy](/blog/2022-07-01-calling-time-on-subworthy) - my RSS to email service.

Given the increased cognitive load at work I'm taking a conscious step-back from working on side-projects for a while and focussing on my reading, writing and cycling.

## Cycling

I had a good run of consistent - almost daily - riding in June and was starting to see some real improvements in fitness and endurance, but then a spell of terrible weather followed by a couple weeks of flu symptons put an end to that.

Now that I'm starting to feel better I'm keen to get back into my riding, and have some ambitious goals for the next 6-12 months.

## Reading

Currently reading:

- [Hyperfocus](https://chrisbailey.com/hyperfocus/) by Chris Bailey
- Die Trying by Lee Childs.

I've been using an iPad Mini as my eReader but in an effort to simplify things I recently purchased a [Kobo Libra 2](https://au.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-libra-2). I still have a few unread titles in Apple Books so will need to stick with the iPad for those, but have found the experience of reading on a device that is _only_ an eReader refreshing (especially with the combination of eInk display and hardware page-turn buttons).

## Listening

My latest podcast of choice is [The Everesting Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-everesting-podcast/id1596373634) - I find endurance challenges fascinating and hope to complete some of my own in the coming year.

## Writing

This blog has been neglected of late, so with the time gained from not being distracted by side-projects I'm focussing on updating it and committing to posting on a semi-regular basis. I've got plenty of content to write - I just need to find a routine to start spending a little time at the keyboard to get the words out.

I have also decided to break my writing out into regular [Blog Articles](/blog), and [Development-related Articles](/dev).  This separation has allowed me to focus more naturally on the two different streams I tend to write about - I can't believe I didn't do it earlier.
