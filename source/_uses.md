# My current setup

_This is my [/uses page](https://uses.tech). It was last updated October 3, 2022._

## Workstation

I have two 13-inch M1 MacBook Pro's - one provided by my work (Space Grey with 16GB RAM), and my personal machine (Silver with the standard 8GB RAM).

At any given time I'll have one of them hooked up to a [Samsung CH89 34" curved monitor](https://www.samsung.com/au/monitors/business/ch89-34-inch-ultra-wqhd-curved-usb-c-lc34h892wgexxy/) with a single USB-C cable for video and power.

Up until recently used an Apple Magic Keyboard (with Touch ID) alongside an Apple Magic Mouse 2, but have decided to switch to a [Logitech MX Mechanical Mini](https://www.logitech.com/en-au/products/keyboards/mx-mechanical.html) keyboard and [MX Vertical](https://www.logitech.com/en-au/products/mice/mx-vertical-ergonomic-mouse.910-005449.html) mouse to save myself from RSI. This all sits on a [Minimal Desk Setups desk pad](https://shop.minimaldesksetups.com/collections/frontpage/products/desk-pad) - large, in dark grey - for a little added comfort.

I tend to run my laptops closed, so I have a [Logitech Streamcam](https://www.logitech.com/en-au/products/webcams/streamcam.960-001283.html) for meetings.

Whilst I'm at my desk I use a set of [Bose QuietComfort 45](https://www.bose.com.au/en_au/products/headphones/noise_cancelling_headphones/quietcomfort-headphones-45.html) headphones - with a set of 3rd Generation AirPods for when I'm on the move.

This all sits on an IKEA [BEKANT](https://www.ikea.com/au/en/p/bekant-desk-sit-stand-white-stained-oak-veneer-black-s99281826/) sit/stand desk. I recently decided to forgo my office chair and now alternate between standing or using a [LIDKULLEN](https://www.ikea.com/au/en/p/lidkullen-active-sit-stand-support-gunnared-dark-grey-90445785/) stool with active sit/stand support.

## Software

For development I keep coming back to [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) - I've got my [preferences and custom key-bindings](https://github.com/theprivateer/phpstorm-settings) _just-so_ and I'm simply not as productive using any other IDE.

For my browser I use Safari - I have Chrome and Firefox installed for cross-browser testing, but very rarely touch them.

[TablePlus](https://tableplus.com) is my go-to for database management.

After a brief stint [trying out Warp](/warp) as my terminal I have gone back to using [iTerm](https://iterm2.com), with [Fig](https://fig.io) and [Oh My ZSH!](https://ohmyz.sh) for added punch.

I'm a little late to the [Tinkerwell](https://tinkerwell.app) party, but now find myself using it virtually every day when I'm developing.

When it comes to my personal email I have been a paid-up user of [HEY](https://www.hey.com) from very early on, and whilst I'm not the biggest fan of the UI, their UX and philosophy towards email more than makes up for it.

I've tried a large number of todo list apps over the years, but [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) is still my favourite by a country mile.

When I need to focus on writing, whether its documentation for work or posts for my blog, I _love_ the understated power of [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer).

An honourable mention should go to [One Switch](/one-switch) - which I use on the daily to make my desktop more presentable for when I'm sharing my screen in Zoom calls.

## Devices

I have an iPhone 13 Mini that I run with a [very minimal setup](/going-light-with-my-phone).

Keeping with the minimal theme, I have a 5th generation iPad mini that I mainly use for reading (Apple Books and the Kindle app). After [shuttering Subworthy](/calling-time-on-subworthy/), my personal RSS-to-email service, I have started to use [Reeder](https://reederapp.com) to consume online content via RSS.

I have a non-cellular Apple Watch Series 6 that I largely use for fitness tracking, rather than any kind of keeping connected on-the-go.
