# Keyboard and Mouse

Up until recently used an Apple Magic Keyboard (with Touch ID) alongside an Apple Magic Mouse 2, but have decided to switch to a [Logitech MX Mechanical Mini](https://www.logitech.com/en-au/products/keyboards/mx-mechanical.html) keyboard and [MX Vertical](https://www.logitech.com/en-au/products/mice/mx-vertical-ergonomic-mouse.910-005449.html) mouse to save myself from RSI. This all sits on a [Minimal Desk Setups desk pad](https://shop.minimaldesksetups.com/collections/frontpage/products/desk-pad) - large, in dark grey - for a little added comfort.
