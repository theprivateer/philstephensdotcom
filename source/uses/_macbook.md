# MacBook Pro

I have two 13-inch M1 MacBook Pro's - one provided by my work (Space Grey with 16GB RAM), and my personal machine (Silver with the standard 8GB RAM).

- Have always been a Mac user
- picked up an M1 MBP late 2021 (personal) - at time had a previous generation non-M1 MBP for work - night and day
- Currently have an M1 MBP supplied by work, only difference is colour and the RAM is bumped to 16GB (does it need it?)
