# Devices

I have an iPhone 13 Mini that I run with a [very minimal setup](/going-light-with-my-phone).

Keeping with the minimal theme, I have a 5th generation iPad mini that I mainly use for reading (Apple Books and the Kindle app). After [shuttering Subworthy](/calling-time-on-subworthy/), my personal RSS-to-email service, I have started to use [Reeder](https://reederapp.com) to consume online content via RSS.

I have a non-cellular Apple Watch Series 6 that I largely use for fitness tracking, rather than any kind of keeping connected on-the-go.
