# Subworthy: Listening to podcast episodes

_**Since writing this I have chosen to [shut down Subworthy](/calling-time-on-subworthy/).**_

RSS is the defacto standard for distributing information about podcast episodes, so naturally you can use [Subworthy](https://subworthy.com) to subscribe to podcast feeds.

As of today, you can now listen to your latest podcasts without leaving your Subworthy daily issue via a simple audio player in the expanded view of an article.
