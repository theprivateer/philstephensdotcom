# First video on YouTube

I broke out my old GoPro Hero 7 for my mountain bike ride a couple mornings ago, and whilst it wasn't exactly the fastest or most elegant run of some of the trails I caught some reasonable footage from the chest mount.

After playing around with the built-in Story feature of the GoPro app to create a [small highlight reel](https://www.instagram.com/p/CHg6GlKFP7q/) I decided to do my first ever 'edit' of the complete run down Carnivore (also known as Carnage), one of the black diamond runs at [Bunyaville Conservation Park](https://www.trailforks.com/region/bunyaville-conservation-park/).

I'm not exactly the next Denis Villeneuve, but with little more than iMovie and a couple random tracks from [Epidemic Sound](https://www.epidemicsound.com) I managed to put together what is, I think, a reasonably successful first attempt.

Was quite an enjoyable process so plan on doing more of these in the future - I've learnt a few things about camera position and sound on this video that I hope to apply to my next trip out.
