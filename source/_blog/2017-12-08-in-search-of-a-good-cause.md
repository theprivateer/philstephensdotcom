# In Search of a Good Cause

Back in 2012 I cycled from the most south-westerly point of the British Isles to the most north-easterly ([Land's End to John o'Groats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land's_End_to_John_o'_Groats)) - roughly 1,600km - and it was one of the most rewarding experiences I've had in recent years.  Lately I have been mulling over an idea to undertake another physical challenge before I turn 40 next September.

I've not quite got it fleshed out yet, but it will involve some sort of endurance cycling trip here in Australia - most likely in my home state of Queensland.  I'm not a particularly athletic person but I also want the distance to reflect the scale of Australia, so it will be much further than before. Whilst the challenge of the ride will in of itself be the rewarding part, I would also like to use it as an opportunity to raise money and awareness for a good cause.

When my friends and I cycled the length of the British Isles we raised a tonne of cash for Cancer Research UK, which as a group was the cause that we all agreed on.  Personally I have many causes that are close to my heart, and it is very difficult for me to choose between them, so I have decided to open it up to suggestions.

Ideally I am looking for a charity that will be willing to help me maximise my fundraising efforts.  Particular areas of interest to me include research into Alzheimer's/dementia, childhood allergies and diabetes, but I am happy to look at other causes as well.  If you have any suggestions, or are a charity interested in working with me, please email me at [phils@hey.com](mailto:phils@hey.com) and we can cue up a chat where I can give a bit more detail about what I'm planning.

Thanks!
