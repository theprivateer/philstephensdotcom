# Software

For development I keep coming back to [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) - I've got my [preferences and custom key-bindings](https://github.com/theprivateer/phpstorm-settings) _just-so_ and I'm simply not as productive using any other IDE.

For my browser I use Safari - I have Chrome and Firefox installed for cross-browser testing, but very rarely touch them.

[TablePlus](https://tableplus.com) is my go-to for database management.

~After a brief stint [trying out Warp](/warp) as my terminal I have gone back to using [iTerm](https://iterm2.com),~

Native Terminal.app with [Fig](https://fig.io) and [Oh My ZSH!](https://ohmyz.sh) for added punch.

I'm a little late to the [Tinkerwell](https://tinkerwell.app) party, but now find myself using it virtually every day when I'm developing.

When it comes to my personal email I have been a paid-up user of [HEY](https://www.hey.com) from very early on, and whilst I'm not the biggest fan of the UI, their UX and philosophy towards email more than makes up for it.

I've tried a large number of todo list apps over the years, but [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) is still my favourite by a country mile.

When I need to focus on writing, whether its documentation for work or posts for my blog, I _love_ the understated power of [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer).

An honourable mention should go to [One Switch](/one-switch) - which I use on the daily to make my desktop more presentable for when I'm sharing my screen in Zoom calls.
